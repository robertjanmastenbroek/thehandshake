## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### What Could Go Wrong?

**1. No demand** (biggest risk)
- Mitigation: Talk to 50 potential users ASAP
- Validate: Are people manually doing escrow now?
- Pivot: If no demand for AI agents, pivot to general crypto escrow

**2. Competitors**
- Mitigation: Move fast, build relationships, lock in integrations
- Moat: Network effects, reputation, Claude Judge (unique)

**3. Regulatory issues**
- Mitigation: Stay on-chain, no custody, just smart contracts
- Consult: Get crypto lawyer review if volume gets big

**4. Smart contract exploit**
- Mitigation: Audit ASAP, bug bounty, insurance fund
- Monitor: Watch transactions closely in early days

**5. Can't acquire users**
- Mitigation: 80% distribution, 20% product
- Test channels fast, double down on what works

---

## 🎯 The Real Secret

**Distribution > Product** (at this stage)

Your product is already good enough. The hard part is:
1. Finding users
2. Convincing them to try it
3. Making them successful
4. Getting them to refer others

**Focus 80% of your time on distribution**, not more features.

Every day ask: "Did I talk to a potential user today?"

---

## 📞 When to Reach Out for Help

- Month 3: If <$20k volume, need to pivot strategy
- Month 6: If <$100k volume, consider paid marketing
- Month 9: If <$200k volume, might need co-founder/hire

**Don't give up before Month 6.** Distribution takes time.
